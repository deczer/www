    <h2>What is Decentralized Network?</h2>
    <p> <li>The primary difference between centralized and decentralized communication networks has to do with the question of who has control over the network itself.</p>
    <p> <li> Decentralized networks are organized in a much more distributed fashion. Each node within the network functions as a separate authority with independent decision-making power regarding how it interacts with other systems. These networks also distribute processing power and workload functions among connected servers.</p>
